# ðŸš€ PERN Stack with Vite, Redux Toolkit, and Sequelize!

Elevate your development experience with this robust boilerplate designed for crafting applications using the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This configuration seamlessly integrates Vite for the frontend, Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, and Sequelizeâ€”an intuitive, promise-based Node.js ORM tool that harmonizes with various databases such as Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, Amazon Redshift, and Snowflakeâ€™s Data Cloud. Sequelize offers resilient transaction support, relationships, eager and lazy loading, read replication, and more.

The server modules adhere to a well-structured and layered architecture.

## Project Structure

The project is thoughtfully organized into two distinct folders:

- **client:** This directory contains the frontend code, with the main entry point located at `client/src/main.js`.
- **server:** The backend code resides here, with the primary entry point at `server/src/server.js`.
